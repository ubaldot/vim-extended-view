# vim-extended-view

Extend the view of your long buffer on other windows!

This plugin provides only one command `:ExtendViewToggle <number>` that
extends your buffer view `<number>` of side-by-side windows. If `<number>` is
not provided, then the buffer view is extended on two windows by default.

To quit the extended view mode, either you run `:ExtendViewToggle <number>` or
just close any extension windows.

Enjoy!
